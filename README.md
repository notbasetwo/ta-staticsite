# TransAdvice Static Site
This is a quickly thrown together static site for TransAdvice.org in Hugo. This is currently considered 'alpha' software and also requires some additional documentation.

## CSV Table Shortcode
In order to build tables easily, a custom shortcode is added `csvtable`. You can see a demonstration of it's usage in `content/donate.md`.

## How do I deploy this?
The [https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/](Hugo docs) are better placed to answer this question.
