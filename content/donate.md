# Donate

Donations for TransAdvice.org are handled by [Hypatia Software Organization](https://hypatiasoftware.org) as directed donations to TransAdvice. Donations are used to maintain existing services such as our _Live Support Chat_, and hosting educational content. Usage of funds directed to TransAdvice.org is dictated by the community's [consensus based governance meetings](https://wiki.transadvice.org/?n=Main.CommunityMeetings) run by and for the TransAdvice.org membership.

Help keep the TransAdvice.org project going, donate today!

**Paypal Donations have been put on hold due to a dispute with Paypal. We are working with paypal to resolve the issue. Paypal has put our funds on hold due to a name change and is trying to claim the donations for themselves. We are working with them to resolve this issue, but they require us to do it via paper mail so it will be a few months before we have an update.**
