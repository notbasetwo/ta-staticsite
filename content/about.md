Since 2004 TransAdvice.org has been a safe and open community driven space for members of the TG/TS (Transgender/Transsexual) community, as well as family members, significant others, friends, and allies. Anyone is welcome here provided you follow our [Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)](https://transadvice.org/aup).

Over the years, a few of our brother/sister networks have merged with us. TransAdvice.org is now also host to TSSupport [http://tssupport.org](http://tssupport.org) as well as TG Help and Support [http://tghelps.org](http://tghelps.org)

Yours,  
~TransAdvice Team
